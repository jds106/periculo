<p>Diversification involves spreading your money across different types of investments with different risks to reduce your overall risk. However, it will not lessen all types of risk. &nbsp;Diversification is an essential part of investing. Investors should only invest a proportion of their available investment funds via Crowdcube and should balance this with safer, more liquid investments. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Risks when investing in equity or funds (including the Crowdcube EIS Fund)</strong></p>

<p>Investing in shares (also known as equity) on Crowdcube does not involve a regular return on your investment unlike mini-bonds which offer interest paid regularly. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Investing in a fund may help to diversify your investments and to spread the risk but general risks while investing in equity continue to apply. Further specific risks are set out on the applicable fund pitch page.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind the following particular risks for equity and fund&nbsp;investments:</p>

<p><strong>Loss of investment or tax relief</strong></p>

<p>The majority of start-up businesses fail or do not scale as planned and therefore investing in these businesses may involve significant risk. &nbsp;It is likely that you may lose all, or part, of your investment. &nbsp;You should only invest an amount that you are willing to lose and should build a diversified portfolio to spread risk and increase the chance of an overall return on your investment capital. If a business you invest in fails, neither the company &ndash; nor Crowdcube &ndash; will pay you back your investment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Tax relief may also be lost due to your personal circumstances or due to the activities of a company.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of liquidity</strong></p>

<p>Liquidity is the ease with which you can sell your shares after you have purchased them. Buying shares in businesses pitching through Crowdcube cannot be sold easily and they are unlikely to be listed on a secondary trading market, such as AIM, Plus or the London Stock Exchange. &nbsp;Even successful companies rarely list shares on such an exchange. In addition, if you purchase B Investment Shares, these are non-voting shares and may not be attractive to potential buyers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rarity of dividends</strong></p>

<p>Dividends are payments made by a business to its shareholders from the company&rsquo;s profits. &nbsp;Most of the companies pitching for equity on the Crowdcube website are start-ups or early stage companies, and these companies will rarely pay dividends to their investors. This means that you are unlikely to see a return on your investment until you are able to sell your shares. &nbsp;Profits are typically re-invested into the business to fuel growth and build shareholder value. Businesses have no obligation to pay shareholder dividends.</p>

<p><strong>Dilution</strong></p>

<p>Any investment in shares made through Crowdcube may be subject to dilution in the future. Dilution occurs when a company issues more shares. Dilution affects every existing shareholder who does not buy any of the new shares being issued. As a result an existing shareholder&#39;s proportionate shareholding of the company is reduced, or &lsquo;diluted&rsquo;-this has an effect on a number of things, including voting, dividends and value.</p>

<p>Some businesses who pitch for equity investment through Crowdcube offer A-Ordinary Shares, which may include pre-emption rights that protect an investor from dilution. &nbsp;In this situation the business must give shareholders with A-Ordinary Shares the opportunity to buy additional shares during a subsequent fundraising round so that they can maintain or preserve their shareholding. Please check a pitch, and the Articles of the company to see if the shares you are buying will have these pre-emption rights. Most companies do not offer pre-emption rights for B Investment Shares.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Risks when investing in Mini-bonds</strong></p>

<p>Mini-bonds are a very different kind of investment to equity and you do not own a stake in the business issuing the mini-bond. &nbsp;Instead you receive regular interest payments from the issuing company (the &ldquo;Issuer&rdquo;) and then return your initial investment back at the end of the mini-bonds term (the maturity). &nbsp; Before investing, you must read and agree to the Bond Instrument for each mini-bond as these contain the exact terms and conditions, including the interest payments and final repayment time between investors and the company raising the money. &nbsp;It is important to understand that Issuers are solely responsible for their financial status and consequently their ability to pay interest and return investors&rsquo; capital when the mini-bonds mature. Crowdcube does not issue the mini-bonds listed on the Crowdcube platform and is not responsible for their performance.&nbsp; Mini-bonds represent a high degree of risk and you should be aware of some of the specific risks involved in investing in them.</p>

<p><strong>Loss of investment and interest payments</strong></p>

<p>Issuers, like all businesses, are vulnerable to financial difficultly and investing in mini-bonds may involve significant risk of default. In the event of an Issuer being unable or unwilling to meet payments of interest and capital, it is likely that you may lose all, or part, of your initial investment and receive no outstanding or future interest payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a business you invest in fails, neither the company you invest in &ndash; nor Crowdcube &ndash; will pay you back you investment. You should only invest an amount that you are willing to lose and should build a diversified portfolio to spread risk.</p>

<p>Mini-bonds are not insured by a third party nor are they protected by any governmental authority such as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. This means that if the Issuer becomes insolvent, investors could lose some or all of their money.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of liquidity</strong></p>

<p>Liquidity is the ease with which you can sell your investments to a third party after you have purchased them. Mini-bonds purchased from Issuers pitching through Crowdcube may be transferrable if specified in the Bond Instrument, however they will not be listed on any formal investment exchange or secondary trading market such as the LSE ORB and so it may be difficult or impossible to find a buyer to purchase them. &nbsp; Please refer to the individual mini-bond documentation for full details of transferability. &nbsp;Investments in mini-bonds through Crowdcube should be viewed as a long term and illiquid investment.</p>

<p><strong>Restricted redemption rights</strong></p>

<p>Issuers of the mini-bonds set the terms for redeeming your capital. Investors should be aware that they will not be able to redeem their initial investment under any circumstances other than those set out in the terms and conditions of the documentation of an individual mini-bond, meaning their capital will be locked up for the entire term of the mini-bond, typically 3-5 years and should therefore be viewed as a long term and illiquid investment.</p>

<p><strong>Unsecured investment</strong></p>

<p>Unless otherwise set out in the Bond Instrument, mini-bonds are typically an unsecured obligation of the Issuer, meaning there is no security over the property or assets of the Issuer supporting the repayment of your &nbsp;interest or capital. &nbsp;This means that if an Issuer fails, it is unlikely that an investor will have their initial investment or outstanding interest payments returned to them because there is no security over any remaining assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Early Call Risk</strong></p>

<p>The Issuer has the right to repay you your money at any time prior to the formal repayment date. Your investment may be materially curtailed because of this.</p>

<p><strong>Lower in the pecking order on winding up</strong></p>

<p>If an Issuer falls into financial difficulty and goes out of business, other creditors and debt holders with seniority &ndash; including fixed charge holders, administrators, employees who are owed wages, banks, and secured debtors - will be compensated first. This means it is unlikely mini-bond investors, whose unsecured investment sits below all of the previously mentioned in the pecking order, will have their initial investment or outstanding interest payments returned to them after higher ranked creditors are compensated.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Interest rate and inflation risks</strong></p>

<p>Mini-bonds pay interest at a fixed rate rather than by reference to an underlying index. Accordingly you should note that a rise in interest rates may adversely affect the relative returns that mini-bonds offer. Further, inflation may reduce the real value of the returns over time.</p>

                <p><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Investor Terms &ndash; last updated 21 October 2015</strong></p>

<p>These Investor Terms are entered into between Crowdcube Capital Limited (&quot;Crowdcube&quot;) of The Innovation Centre, University of Exeter, Exeter EX4 4RN with the company number 09095835. which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the &quot;FCA&quot;) (No. 650205), and any person (the &quot;Investor&quot;) who wishes to subscribe for shares, debt securities or units in funds offered by an investee company or fund (the &quot;Investee&quot;) in response to an investment proposition (&quot;Pitch&quot;) made by the Investee via the website located at www.crowdcube.com (the &quot;Website&quot;). Crowdcube provides services relating to the arranging of the investment by the Investor in shares, debt securities or units in funds in or offered by the Investee (the &quot;Investment&quot;).</p>

<p>5. INVESTMENT PROCESS</p>

<p>5.1. The Investor will be entitled to place a revocable order to subscribe for shares, debt securities or fund units in an Investee in any Pitch on the Website for a period (the &quot;Offer Period&quot;) ending on the date specified by Investee on the Pitch which may be updated from time to time and Crowdcube reserves the right to end Pitches early or extend the Offer Period in its absolute discretion.&nbsp; The subscription agreement for the Investment is between the Investor and Investee such that the offer from the Investor is to the Investee and not to Crowdcube. &nbsp;The Investee may accept or reject any order up until expiry of the email as set out in clause 5.3 below. &nbsp;Crowdcube is not a party to the agreement to invest between the Investor and Investee and Crowdcube&rsquo;s service is limited to arranging the investment.</p>

<p>5.2.&nbsp; The Investor shall put in place payment arrangements to ensure that the Subscription Price is paid in accordance with clause 5.5 below.&nbsp; This may require the Investor to agree to a payment service provider&rsquo;s terms and conditions or otherwise provide satisfactory evidence of payment to Crowdcube.&nbsp; It is Investor&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that any such payment arrangements are established and maintained and that monies are transferred in accordance with clause 5.5 below.</p>

<p>5.3. If a Pitch is successful, the Investee will instruct Crowdcube to circulate a copy of the Investee&#39;s proposed Articles of Association, bond instrument or fund documentation to each Investor by email, and to request that each Investor inform Crowdcube by email within the time period specified in the email if they no longer wish to proceed with the Investment. If Crowdcube receives no response from the Investor within the specified time period, the Investor will be deemed to have confirmed his order and the Investee will accept his order and such order will become an irrevocable firm order upon expiry of the time period set out in the email, with completion of the investment conditional upon the Investee receiving payment from the Investor and provided the Investee receives at least 90% of its original Pitch target investment amount.&nbsp; If 90% of the Pitch target is not received by the Investee then clause 6.3 applies.</p>

<p>5.4. If for any reason the confirmation email is not received by an Investor (whether this is known or notified to Crowdcube or not), otherwise than as a result of fraud or gross negligence by Crowdcube, Crowdcube shall not be liable to the Investor or the Investee for any losses, claims, damages, etc suffered by the Investor, and Crowdcube shall be entitled to proceed on the assumption that the Investor wishes to proceed with the Investment.</p>

<p>5.5. If a Pitch is successful, when the Investor places an order to subscribe for shares in an Investee, and subject to non-revocation at expiry of the confirmation email an agreement shall then subsist between the Investor and the Investee, or a third party on behalf of the Investee, to transfer the subscription price of the relevant shares or debt securities (the &quot;Subscription Price&quot;) to the Investee. Shares or debt securities in the Investee will be issued to the Investor by the Investee and the Subscription Price will be transferred to the account of the Investee following the end of the Offer Period. If the Pitch is not successful, no such agreement between the Investor and the Investee shall arise.</p>

<p>5.6. If the Pitch is unsuccessful or the order not completed for any reason, the Investor&#39;s order will not be transferred to another Pitch or Investee, and no substitute service will be provided.</p>

<p>6. INVESTMENTS</p>

<p>6.1. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube&#39;s affiliates, and/or the proprietors, officers or employees of Crowdcube and/or such affiliates may consider expressing interest or subscribing for shares in an Investee. If the Investor becomes aware of this, he agrees not to rely upon the same in making a decision whether to invest in an Investee, and confirms that any decision by him to invest in an Investee is not based upon any representation, information, action, omission or otherwise of Crowdcube, its subsidiaries or affiliates or the proprietors or employees of Crowdcube, its subsidiaries or its affiliates.</p>

<p>6.2. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube approves each Pitch as a financial promotion but does not provide advice or any form of recommendation regarding the suitability or quality of the Investment. The Investor acknowledges that the approval of the Pitch as a financial promotion by Crowdcube, or the investment in an Investee by any person referred to in clause 6.1 is not an indication of approval of the Pitch generally, and the Investor confirms that it shall take no inference from or make any reference to the same.</p>

<p>6.3. The Investor confirms that should an Investee not ultimately attain the stated desired target level of investment as set out in its Pitch, through withdrawals after the expiry of the Offer Period, or failure by other Investors to transfer the Subscription Price to the Investee, neither the Investee nor Crowdcube is required to inform the Investor of this failure, and the Investor may still be required to purchase the shares he ordered, provided that the level of investment received by the Investee is at least 90% of the desired target level of investment as set out in its Pitch. If the Investee ultimately attains less than 90% of the desired target level of investment as set out in its Pitch, the agreement for investment between the Investor and Investee will not complete and Crowdcube will use its reasonable endeavours to arrange for the Investee to cancel the Investment made by the Investor and return the Subscription Price to the Investor. The Investor consents to Crowdcube releasing such information as is reasonably necessary, to the Investee to allow such return of the Subscription Price, and the Investor undertakes to co-operate with Crowdcube and the Investee, including in relation to any transaction fees or charges, to facilitate the cancellation of the Investment and the return of the Subscription Price.</p>

<p>6.4. Investors are encouraged to ensure that arrangements are put in place for their next of kin to be informed of their order and the Crowdcube process, and that instructions are provided to enable the Investor&#39;s order to be withdrawn before it is converted to a irrevocable order on the occurrence of the Investor&#39;s death, insolvency or incapacity. Crowdcube accepts no responsibility or liability for orders not being withdrawn before being converted to a firm order through the failure of the Investor to put in place such an arrangement, or the failure of the next of kin to communicate a withdrawal.</p>

<p>6.5. Investors, or in accordance with clause 6.4, their next of kin, are entitled to withdraw their order at any time prior to it becoming a firm order upon the expiry of the confirmation email as set out in clause 5.2 above.</p>

<p>6.6 If a Pitch is cancelled for any reason or does not reach its target, Investors acknowledge that Crowdcube is no longer arranging or approving financial promotions for the Investee and that if the Investor engages in any further conversations or investments outside of Crowdcube that Crowdcube has no liability or involvement with such transaction and that no statement made on Crowdcube or elsewhere by the Investee or by Crowdcube may be relied upon.</p>

<p>7. INVESTEE ARTICLES, BOND INSTRUMENT OR FUND DOCUMENTATION</p>

<p>7.1. The Investor acknowledges that, as a consequence of him becoming a shareholder of an Investee, he shall be subject to the provisions of the Investee&#39;s Articles of Association (which constitute an agreement between all of the Investee&#39;s shareholders), bond instrument or fund investment agreement, which Articles of Association, bond instrument or fund investment agreement will include certain restrictions on the shares, bonds or fund units issued and certain rights and obligations will attach to such shares, bonds or fund units and fund investments.</p>

<p>7.2. The Articles of Association will be in the form notified to the Investor by Crowdcube in the confirmation email referred to in clause 5.2 above and/or as set out on the pitch and may be subject to other documentation or disclosures.</p>

<p>7.3. The Investor acknowledges that, as a consequence of him becoming a bondholder of an Investee, he shall be subject to the provisions of the Bond Instrument or other debt instrument and associated terms and conditions of the particular debt security (which constitute an agreement between each bondholder and the relevant Investee) which will include certain restrictions on the debt securities issued and certain rights and obligations will attach to such debt securities.</p>

<p>8. REGULATION AND LIABILITY</p>

<p>8.1. The Investor acknowledges and accepts that the Website includes a forum which is an integral part of an Investee&#39;s Pitch which is intended as a service to Investees to put them in contact with Investors, and thus that Crowdcube&#39;s investigation of the Investees and the content of their Pitches is limited, and accordingly Crowdcube makes no warranty or representation and assumes no liability in respect of the Investees or the content of their Pitches. The Investor must make his own assessment of the viability, accuracy and prospects of the Investees, their Pitches, and any relevant investment propositions and should consult his professional advisers should he require any assistance in making such an assessment or should the Investor require any services whatsoever in connection with Crowdcube. In particular, the attention of the Investors is drawn to the disclaimer, risk warning and regulatory notice on each Pitch.</p>

<p>8.2. The Investor warrants, represents and undertakes to Crowdcube that (i) the Investor has categorised himself or herself correctly under clause 3 above; (ii) shall comply with any terms and conditions associated with the use of the forums on the Website, and in particular undertakes not to post any illegal, defamatory or inappropriate material or advice to invest and acknowledges that Crowdcube will in its absolute discretion have the power to determine whether posts by Investors breach this clause 8.2 or are otherwise inappropriate and may be removed by Crowdcube.</p>

<p>8.3. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube does not provide the Investor with any advice or recommendations in relation to investments. Nevertheless it is typically considered prudent for Investors to consider spreading their risk over multiple investments and Crowdcube encourages this approach.</p>

<p>8.4. The Investor acknowledges that in approving the Pitch as a financial promotion, Crowdcube has concluded that the Pitch, taken as a whole in the context of the above, is fair, clear and not misleading. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube has reviewed any factual statements included within the Pitch and obtained evidence of their accuracy from the Investee. However, the Investor&#39;s attention is drawn to the fact that the evidence is obtained from the Investee itself and has not been audited by Crowdcube, which means that it may contain inaccuracies, be incomplete or be a forgery.</p>

<p>8.5. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube has checked that aspirational statements contained within the Pitch are phrased appropriately in light of their speculative nature. However, the Investor acknowledges that the Investee is likely to be a start-up company and as such may have high ambitions which may be unachievable and exaggerated. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube may approve statements that convey those ambitions even where it does not believe, or does not have a view on whether it is likely, that they will be fully realised and the Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube encourages Investors to consider the information provided in the context it is being provided.</p>

<p>8.6 The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube makes no representation, warranty or undertaking relating to any claims made by Investees, including, without limitation, that the Investee and the Investment will qualify for or be subject to any tax benefits such as EIS and SEIS or that these tax benefit are pending approval of HMRC. Investor acknowledges and agrees that tax benefits may change or be disqualified and shall not hold Crowdcube liable for any loss arising as a result of a tax benefit (including , without limitation EIS or SEIS) not applying to an Investment, including without limitation in circumstances where tax has been &lsquo;clawed back&rsquo; from an Investor by HMRC.</p>

<p>8.8 Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit liability for death or personal injury resulting from the negligence of either party or their agents or employees nor for fraud by or on behalf of either party. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any liability of to the extent that liability may not be excluded or limited by any applicable law or regulation.</p>

<p>8.9 With the exception of clause 8.8 above and any breach of warranty by the Investor (which shall have unlimited liability), the liability of either party (which in the case of Crowdcube shall include Crowdcube&rsquo;s affiliate or group companies, including Crowdcube Ltd; and directors, officers and employees of Crowdcube Ltd, Crowdcube Capital Ltd, Crowdcube Nominees Ltd and Crowdcube Ventures Ltd) in contract, tort, negligence, pre-contract or other representations or otherwise arising out of this agreement or the performance of its obligations under this agreement shall be limited in aggregate to the total amount invested by Investor on www.crowdcube.com up to the date of the event leading to the claim or &pound;10,000 whichever is the lesser amount.</p>

<p>8.10&nbsp; Neither party shall be liable in contract, tort (including negligence), pre-contract or other representations (other than fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations) or otherwise under this Agreement for: (a) any economic losses (including loss of revenues, profits, contracts, business or anticipated savings); or (b) any special, indirect or consequential losses; whether or not such losses were known to the parties at the commencement of this Agreement.</p>

<p>8.11&nbsp; Where an Investor invests via a nominee, the nominee company is responsible for the administration of the nominee and trust agreement in accordance with the relevant trust agreement and neither Crowdcube, nor any subsidiary or holding company of Crowdcube, or any other subsidiary of Crowdcube&rsquo;s holding company (other than a nominee company where this forms part of Crowdcube&rsquo;s group) is a party or trustee to the nominee agreement or otherwise responsible for the Investor&rsquo;s beneficial shareholding via the nominee company or otherwise and is not liable for the actions or inactions of the nominee company or for loss or damage of any nature arising from Investors investment via a nominee.</p>

<p>9. TERMINATION</p>

<p>9.1. Subject to clause 9.2, the Investor may terminate this agreement on 7 days&#39; written notice to Crowdcube.</p>

<p>9.2. If an Investor has an outstanding or incomplete order for investment in any Investee which has not been resolved in accordance with Clause 5.1, the Investor may only terminate this Agreement if they have (i) served written notice by email on Crowdcube; and (ii), has withdrawn his order from the ongoing Pitch either via the Pitch, or by responding to the confirmation email confirming his withdrawal.</p>

<p>9.3. Once an order has been made firm with an Investee in accordance with this agreement, the Investor has entered into a contract with the Investee direct on such terms as are agreed with the Investee, and Crowdcube shall have no further obligations or involvement in the Investment unless otherwise notified to Investor.</p>

<p>9.4. Crowdcube may terminate this agreement at any time in the event that:</p>

<p>9.4.1. the Investor breaches these Investor Terms; or</p>

<p>and the Investor&#39;s use of the Crowdcube platform will be terminated.</p>

<p>9.5. If Crowdcube terminates this agreement in accordance with clause 9.4 whilst the Investor has placed an order that has not been completed by the issue of shares in the relevant Investee, Crowdcube reserves the right to inform the Investee of the termination and take such steps as are necessary to ensure that the Investor&#39;s order is not completed.</p>

<p>9.6 Clause 5, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive termination of this agreement and if an Investor has made an application to invest or has invested in an Investee through Crowdcube then any clause in this agreement that is required in order to</p>
