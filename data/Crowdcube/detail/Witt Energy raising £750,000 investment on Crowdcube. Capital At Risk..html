                                    <h2>The Idea</h2>
                <div class="userText">
                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Witt Limited has developed a patented fully scalable innovative energy harvesting system (the “WITT”), that converts motion on land, sea and from the air into electricity.  Because it can capture all motion, clockwise, anti-clockwise, back and forth and up and down (known as 6 degrees of motion), which we believe no other device can do, it can generate up to 100% more energy from motion than traditional devices based on our research. The WITT can be built to a size to generate grid scale electrical power from the ocean to miniature scale to recharge mobile phones, and to every size in between, which, according to our research offers the widest range of applications compared to any other power generation technology. </p><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> </p><p>The UK is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 but which current renewable energy systems will enable us to reach this target? There is an increasing need to provide power remotely which is intensifying growth in global energy harvesting devices but which ones will drive the market forward? </p><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> The WITT device is a patented and fully scaleable innovative transmission system that converts naturally-occurring motional energy into rotational motion for the production of electricity. The WITT device is able to turn motion from water, wind, vehicle, humans and animals into usable power. It can take all motion, and convert it into power.</p><p>From a small device on a key fob that generates energy from walking to recharge a mobile phone, to a large grid scale device to generate megawatts of power at sea, the applications for our WITT platform technology are numerous. As the WITT captures energy from all 6 degrees of motion, it can capture up to 100% more energy from motion than comparable devices. We believe this makes it the optimum technology to be deployed to generate renewable electricity from the sea. We are working with a consortium including international partners to set out how advantageous the WITT is compared to other ocean grid scale power generating devices.</p><p>We already have working prototypes that demonstrate the WITT technology capability.  The next stage will be to use this funding to build the first WITT products to be sold to potential customers already wanting WITT products based on current discussions.  This will move the company into profitability.</p><p>First units to be manufactured are 200 watt marine WITTs to provide autonomous power for numerous marine applications requiring renewable power 24/7. Here we are working with Global Bearings Company Schaeffler, and Gibbs Gears, to ensure that we bring this product to manufacturing readiness without risk. A 15 watt marine WITT will aim to follow thereafter.</p><p>Future applications will be undertaken with global license or joint venture partners. These will include a small backpack WITT to generate power whilst walking away from home. There is specific interest from defence organisations based on preliminary discussions including the US Department of Defence. Another will be smaller personal power units to recharge mobile phones from walking. This is a huge market with many users, particularly in the developing world, not having regular access to power.  There will be multiple applications for these small units aside of personal power.  One such being survival applications where power can be provided from sea motion to continually power a tracker to locate survivors from a plane crash on water, or from passengers on stricken ships wearing life jackets, etc.</p><p><strong>Achievements and Traction:</strong>  </p><ul> <li>Witt Limited (WL) has assembled a high calibre Board chaired by the former Commander-in-Chief of Britain’s Royal Navy</li> <li>The WITT has won numerous awards and grants since 2011 totalling over £750,000.</li> <li>Winner of the prestigious Ocean Exchange (US) General Dynamics Gulfstream ‘Leap to Zero’ award which included a cash prize of $100,000 in 2013, Smart Grants from Innovate UK in 2014, and a Collaborative Grant from InnovateUK to set out the WITT’s capability to generate offshore wave power.</li> <li>WL is also a Shell Springboard 2015 winner receiving a cash prize of £40,000.</li> <li>Our current prototypes have generated interest from numerous potential clients and development partners including Schaeffler, GDF Suez, US Department of Defence, Survitec and Liquid Robotics.  Also interest from yacht owner Phil Sharp, the yachtsman seeking to sail around the world on a completely emissions free basis.</li> <li>There have been 3 angel funding rounds. The 1st in 2012 raised ~£100,000 off a valuation of £0.9mn The 2nd in 2013 raised £56,000 off £4.5mn. The 3rd in 2014 raised £70,000 off £7.4mn</li> <li>Global bearings company, Schaeffler, and Gibbs Gears have agreed to work with us to bring to manufacture the first WITT for marine markets.</li> <li> <p>WL has received 2 unsolicited approaches from global entities relating to two specific licensing opportunities.  These may lead to our first licensing deals. </p> </li></ul><p> </p><p>That both Schaeffler and Gibbs Gears are to work with us demonstrates their commitment to see our technology commercialised.  Indeed Schaeffler are providing their initial engineering support to Witt Ltd on a zero cost basis, such is their commitment to the development of renewable energy solutions that have the potential to make a significant positive impact on climate change. With oceans covering 71% of the earth's surface, they see water power as an important renewable energy resource, and the capability to generate energy from ocean waves as representing a key future-oriented growth field for Schaeffler.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>Background:</strong> The WITT was developed by Martin Wickett who designed and built the first WITT prototypes in his workshop. This is such an incredible accomplishment  to build a device that converts energy from all six degrees of motion into power.  We have encountered considerable scepticism that we could have actually built such a device successfully ahead of big corporations, with their huge R&D budgets and resources. This was best illustrated by a senior US General who met with us at the Innovative Energy Solutions for Military Applications trade show in Vilnius in November 2014.  He came to our stand and politely but directly stated that we must be another company that has claimed to be able to capture energy from all 6 degrees of motion.  Many make this claim he said but none have been able to achieve this.  He then picked up the WITT and started to generate power from motion whilst he moved the WITT around.  He then brought around many other US defence attendees at the show and showed them the WITT device saying that these guys have actually done it - they have developed a solution that captures motion completely.</p><p>As the Founders, Martin & Mairi Wickett, have worked relentlessly to bring the technology forward, recognising that to commercialise WITTS into a global market across many applications, they needed a team of highly experienced professionals with global reach. This is why Witt Limited is now working with Schaeffler and Gibbs Gears, and has assembled a highly experienced board with a track record in delivering shareholder performance.  Our intention is to turn Witt Limited into the world’s largest renewable energy company in terms of units sold, and applications delivered.  Further we are committed towards moving the global mindset towards thinking that if I can use a WITT to generate my own personal power, I should do so to empower myself and reduce my own carbon footprint at the same time.</p><p><strong>Future Opportunities</strong>: Reducing the global carbon footprint by increasing grid scale power produced from the WITT is a longer term goal as we believe the WITT’s capability to <strong>generate grid scale ocean power</strong> could provide a significant contribution towards generating 80% of the UK’s power from renewables by 2050.  WL has engaged experts in marine technology to demonstrate our capability to generate offshore grid scale power at a competitive long term cost.  We will then liaise with power generation entities to procure their funding support to trial much larger WITT devices at sea.  The WITT also has the capability to generate <strong>power from wind</strong> for use by individual home owners.  This application will be explored further after our initial WITT devices are commercialised. </p>

            <h2>The Market</h2>
            <div class="userText">
                <p><strong>Market: </strong>The market opportunity globally extends to everywhere a power unit is needed to generate power from motion from national level down to individual needs.</p><p><strong>Ocean Power Market</strong>:  For global grid scale power generation from the ocean, the IEA believes that ocean energy technologies could start playing a sizable role in the global electricity mix by 2030. Indeed similar rates of rapid growth between 2030 and 2050 as offshore wind has achieved in the last 20 years are forecast. There are estimates of a worldwide potential of up to 337 GW of wave and tidal energy capacity by 2050 (of which EU is 188 GW - European Ocean Energy Association), satisfying 15% of European electricity demand and in some countries up to 20%. Ahead of this timetable, the global wave and tidal energy market is predicted to be worth US$10.1bn by 2020 forecasts Transparency Market Research. As the WITT can convert wave power from any direction into electricity, we expect that the WITT could become the wave energy harvester technology of choice taking at least a 20% market share. Smaller ocean units could serve individual communities by the sea.</p><p><strong>Smaller Marine WITTs</strong>:  First applications are WITTs for ocean yacht, buoys, marine safety, and floating devices generally where we already have interest. The potential global boat park is up to 24mn units based on 2012 data from the International Council of Marine Industry Associations, which reported a boat park exceeding 24mn light vessels from 23 countries excluding China and many other key countries with substantial ocean frontages. This research also sets out the US as being the largest boat builder globally  WL needs to focus selling WITTs for new build deployment initially in the UK & US via key distributors. </p><p>Increasingly wealthy middle classes in many countries will provide substantial growth in the leisure marine sector and Lucintel forecasts the global pleasure boat market will grow to $30.63bn in 2017.  </p><p>WL is currently generating interest from GDF Suez, Liquid Robotics, Survitec and other boat owners for its marine WITT technology.</p><p><strong>Future Applications – Backpack WITTs:</strong>  When a commercialisation license or joint venture partner iss identified, a backpack WITT will be built to generate power whilst walking where we have potential interest from the US Department of Defense based on early, high level discussions. </p><p>Orders could be significant for this application which could be at a high value high profit level initially. According to <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/armies.htm">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/armies.htm</a> the top 40 military countries have an active military force of ~15mn soldiers. According to Mordor Intelligence, the Global Soldier Modernization Market is worth $6.5bn pa.</p><p>Add to this orders from other personnel such as Police, Rescue Services, Homeland Security where there is a need to retain powered personal communications in the event of blackouts. Consumer users could readily double these numbers and more so.<span id="ddClaim20785-0" style="line-height:22.4px">There were 36.22m people hiking in the US in 2014.</span><span id="ddRef20785-0" style="line-height:22.4px"><sup><a href="#ddRefLink20785">[38]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>The market for personal power units</strong> to recharge mobile phones from walking is large with 1.2 bn phones sold in 2014. Consumer sales could be achieved on line and via Amazon.</p><p>These are just a sample of numerous potential uses.   </p><p>Distribution arrangements for specific product could be achieved via RS Components, the trading brand of Stock Exchange listed Electrocomponents plc, the global distributor for engineering components, who approached us directly and with whom we are now holding preliminary discussions.</p><p> </p><p><strong>WITTs USPs:</strong></p><ul> <li>Completely scalable patented platform technology</li> <li>As the WITT captures energy from all 6 degrees of motion, it can convert wave power from any direction into electricity</li> <li>Low cost, clean tech, energy generation solution.</li> <li>Collects power 24/7 in the marine environment</li> <li>Sealed structure, protects from external environment</li> <li>Designed to be maintenance free</li></ul><p><strong>Competition:</strong> Competing technologies can be viewed against these USPs. </p><p><u>Large scale wave power:</u> We believe existing wave energy harvesters convert less of the wave’s power into electricity and moreover are directly exposed to the elements whereas the WITT floats on the surface in a protective sealed structure. This results in the WITT providing a much more competitive long term energy cost with much lower maintenance needs.</p><p><u>WITTs for marine application:</u> the main competition is solar panels however solar is not 24/7, thus needs back up batteries, and the panels need cleaning from seabirds etc. We've learnt that US Coast guards send out maintenance ships to all their buoys regularly to clean the panels. The WITT has no maintenance requirement and provides power 24/7. Also solar panels do not provide the same level of power in winter, especially in the Northern hemisphere.</p><p><u>Dismounted Soldier WITT:</u> There is early interest from defence organisations based on preliminary discussions for this application  Competing devices are a spring mounted backback where soldier has to actively push up/spring down the back pack to generate kinetic energy. The 2nd is a knee brace technology where the soldier’s movement of their legs generates kinetic energy but requires extra effort to move forward. Both require pro-active energy input whereas the WITT is passive. There are potential health issues with these competing devices.</p><p><u>For Mobile phones:</u> competition is back up batteries but these need to be recharged whereas the WITT requires no mains access – just motion!</p>

        <div class="userText">
            <p><strong>Generating Value for Shareholders</strong>:</p><p>Because the WITT has such a wide range of applications, we believe there will be many options that could be pursued to generate shareholder value and an exit for investors. Witt Limited will remain the holding company, and will hold and further enhance the intellectual property and patent portfolio relating to the WITT. Separate subsidiaries would additionally be created to serve different WITT applications and markets. The company could certainly be looking to provide a return to investors within 5 years.</p><p>Shareholder Value could be achieved by securing a market listing or a trade sale of the whole group, or alternatively, through the sale of a subsidiary company if the advantages to be derived maximise the value of the whole business to shareholders.</p><p>For example a micro device subsidiary selling energy harvesting power units to the consumer market could be sold off in isolation to the likes of Samsung, Apple or Google etc. Consider the considerations paid for Nest ($3.2bn) and Beats ($3bn).</p><p>Another area where our technology could generate shareholder returns is in the defence sector where global defence entities are keen to exploit new technology opportunities, and could acquire a defence WITT subsidiary.  Similarly in the survival sector, Survitec Group, recently acquired for £440mn, have a track record of buying businesses in their sector and they could be a candidate for a defence or survival related subsidiary acquisition. </p><p>Alternatively a Grid Scale Power subsidiary could be sold to the likes of GE, Siemens etc.</p><p>In summary the wide range of applications provide many potential options for achieving shareholder value and exits which may involve multiple exits for shareholders! Our Board is highly experienced and will ensure that shareholder returns are optimised.</p>

        <div class="userText">
                                    <strong>Witt Energy</strong> has submitted their plans to raise money, details of their structure and trade etc. to HMRC and has been given advance assurance that the proposed share issue is likely to qualify for Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) tax reliefs relating to their shares.
                <br /><br />
                Tax relief is available to individuals only, who subscribe for shares in an <strong>Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)</strong>. Relief is at 30 per cent of the cost of the shares, to be set against the individual's Income Tax liability for the tax year in which the investment was made.
                <br /><br />
                If you sell, give away, exchange or otherwise dispose of shares, tax reliefs can reduce your <strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong> bill. Your shares must meet certain conditions to qualify for these reliefs.
                <br /><br />
                <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/eis/index.htm">Please visit the HMRC website for further information on EIS tax relief</a>
                <br /><br />
                                    The availability of any tax relief, including EIS and SEIS, depends on the individual circumstances of each investors, and may be subject to change in the future.
            If you are in any doubt about the availability of any tax reliefs, or the tax treatment of your investment, you should obtain independent tax advice before proceeding with your investment.

            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>To help you understand the risks involved when investing in shares,&nbsp;mini-bonds and funds on Crowdcube, please read the following risk summary. &nbsp;Please #investaware and diversify your investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The need for diversification when you invest</strong></p>

<p>Diversification involves spreading your money across different types of investments with different risks to reduce your overall risk. However, it will not lessen all types of risk. &nbsp;Diversification is an essential part of investing. Investors should only invest a proportion of their available investment funds via Crowdcube and should balance this with safer, more liquid investments. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Risks when investing in equity or funds (including the Crowdcube EIS Fund)</strong></p>

<p>Investing in shares (also known as equity) on Crowdcube does not involve a regular return on your investment unlike mini-bonds which offer interest paid regularly. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Investing in a fund may help to diversify your investments and to spread the risk but general risks while investing in equity continue to apply. Further specific risks are set out on the applicable fund pitch page.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind the following particular risks for equity and fund&nbsp;investments:</p>

<p><strong>Loss of investment or tax relief</strong></p>

<p>The majority of start-up businesses fail or do not scale as planned and therefore investing in these businesses may involve significant risk. &nbsp;It is likely that you may lose all, or part, of your investment. &nbsp;You should only invest an amount that you are willing to lose and should build a diversified portfolio to spread risk and increase the chance of an overall return on your investment capital. If a business you invest in fails, neither the company &ndash; nor Crowdcube &ndash; will pay you back your investment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Tax relief may also be lost due to your personal circumstances or due to the activities of a company.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of liquidity</strong></p>

<p>Liquidity is the ease with which you can sell your shares after you have purchased them. Buying shares in businesses pitching through Crowdcube cannot be sold easily and they are unlikely to be listed on a secondary trading market, such as AIM, Plus or the London Stock Exchange. &nbsp;Even successful companies rarely list shares on such an exchange. In addition, if you purchase B Investment Shares, these are non-voting shares and may not be attractive to potential buyers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rarity of dividends</strong></p>

<p>Dividends are payments made by a business to its shareholders from the company&rsquo;s profits. &nbsp;Most of the companies pitching for equity on the Crowdcube website are start-ups or early stage companies, and these companies will rarely pay dividends to their investors. This means that you are unlikely to see a return on your investment until you are able to sell your shares. &nbsp;Profits are typically re-invested into the business to fuel growth and build shareholder value. Businesses have no obligation to pay shareholder dividends.</p>

<p><strong>Dilution</strong></p>

<p>Any investment in shares made through Crowdcube may be subject to dilution in the future. Dilution occurs when a company issues more shares. Dilution affects every existing shareholder who does not buy any of the new shares being issued. As a result an existing shareholder&#39;s proportionate shareholding of the company is reduced, or &lsquo;diluted&rsquo;-this has an effect on a number of things, including voting, dividends and value.</p>

<p>Some businesses who pitch for equity investment through Crowdcube offer A-Ordinary Shares, which may include pre-emption rights that protect an investor from dilution. &nbsp;In this situation the business must give shareholders with A-Ordinary Shares the opportunity to buy additional shares during a subsequent fundraising round so that they can maintain or preserve their shareholding. Please check a pitch, and the Articles of the company to see if the shares you are buying will have these pre-emption rights. Most companies do not offer pre-emption rights for B Investment Shares.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Risks when investing in Mini-bonds</strong></p>

<p>Mini-bonds are a very different kind of investment to equity and you do not own a stake in the business issuing the mini-bond. &nbsp;Instead you receive regular interest payments from the issuing company (the &ldquo;Issuer&rdquo;) and then return your initial investment back at the end of the mini-bonds term (the maturity). &nbsp; Before investing, you must read and agree to the Bond Instrument for each mini-bond as these contain the exact terms and conditions, including the interest payments and final repayment time between investors and the company raising the money. &nbsp;It is important to understand that Issuers are solely responsible for their financial status and consequently their ability to pay interest and return investors&rsquo; capital when the mini-bonds mature. Crowdcube does not issue the mini-bonds listed on the Crowdcube platform and is not responsible for their performance.&nbsp; Mini-bonds represent a high degree of risk and you should be aware of some of the specific risks involved in investing in them.</p>

<p><strong>Loss of investment and interest payments</strong></p>

<p>Issuers, like all businesses, are vulnerable to financial difficultly and investing in mini-bonds may involve significant risk of default. In the event of an Issuer being unable or unwilling to meet payments of interest and capital, it is likely that you may lose all, or part, of your initial investment and receive no outstanding or future interest payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a business you invest in fails, neither the company you invest in &ndash; nor Crowdcube &ndash; will pay you back you investment. You should only invest an amount that you are willing to lose and should build a diversified portfolio to spread risk.</p>

<p>Mini-bonds are not insured by a third party nor are they protected by any governmental authority such as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. This means that if the Issuer becomes insolvent, investors could lose some or all of their money.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of liquidity</strong></p>

<p>Liquidity is the ease with which you can sell your investments to a third party after you have purchased them. Mini-bonds purchased from Issuers pitching through Crowdcube may be transferrable if specified in the Bond Instrument, however they will not be listed on any formal investment exchange or secondary trading market such as the LSE ORB and so it may be difficult or impossible to find a buyer to purchase them. &nbsp; Please refer to the individual mini-bond documentation for full details of transferability. &nbsp;Investments in mini-bonds through Crowdcube should be viewed as a long term and illiquid investment.</p>

<p><strong>Restricted redemption rights</strong></p>

<p>Issuers of the mini-bonds set the terms for redeeming your capital. Investors should be aware that they will not be able to redeem their initial investment under any circumstances other than those set out in the terms and conditions of the documentation of an individual mini-bond, meaning their capital will be locked up for the entire term of the mini-bond, typically 3-5 years and should therefore be viewed as a long term and illiquid investment.</p>

<p><strong>Unsecured investment</strong></p>

<p>Unless otherwise set out in the Bond Instrument, mini-bonds are typically an unsecured obligation of the Issuer, meaning there is no security over the property or assets of the Issuer supporting the repayment of your &nbsp;interest or capital. &nbsp;This means that if an Issuer fails, it is unlikely that an investor will have their initial investment or outstanding interest payments returned to them because there is no security over any remaining assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Early Call Risk</strong></p>

<p>The Issuer has the right to repay you your money at any time prior to the formal repayment date. Your investment may be materially curtailed because of this.</p>

<p><strong>Lower in the pecking order on winding up</strong></p>

<p>If an Issuer falls into financial difficulty and goes out of business, other creditors and debt holders with seniority &ndash; including fixed charge holders, administrators, employees who are owed wages, banks, and secured debtors - will be compensated first. This means it is unlikely mini-bond investors, whose unsecured investment sits below all of the previously mentioned in the pecking order, will have their initial investment or outstanding interest payments returned to them after higher ranked creditors are compensated.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Interest rate and inflation risks</strong></p>

<p>Mini-bonds pay interest at a fixed rate rather than by reference to an underlying index. Accordingly you should note that a rise in interest rates may adversely affect the relative returns that mini-bonds offer. Further, inflation may reduce the real value of the returns over time.</p>

                    <p>If you love the idea of Witt Energy and want to make an investment but think the valuation isn't quite right, you can make an alternative offer. Enter what you think the business is worth and how much you want to invest and we'll re-calculate how much equity needs to be offered and what your share of it will be. Do not include the funds being based on Crowdcube in your valuation. The investment target can't be altered.

For people that have already invested, their equity will be recalculated based on the new valuation.</p>

<p>5. INVESTMENT PROCESS</p>

<p>5.1. The Investor will be entitled to place a revocable order to subscribe for shares, debt securities or fund units in an Investee in any Pitch on the Website for a period (the &quot;Offer Period&quot;) ending on the date specified by Investee on the Pitch which may be updated from time to time and Crowdcube reserves the right to end Pitches early or extend the Offer Period in its absolute discretion.&nbsp; The subscription agreement for the Investment is between the Investor and Investee such that the offer from the Investor is to the Investee and not to Crowdcube. &nbsp;The Investee may accept or reject any order up until expiry of the email as set out in clause 5.3 below. &nbsp;Crowdcube is not a party to the agreement to invest between the Investor and Investee and Crowdcube&rsquo;s service is limited to arranging the investment.</p>

<p>5.2.&nbsp; The Investor shall put in place payment arrangements to ensure that the Subscription Price is paid in accordance with clause 5.5 below.&nbsp; This may require the Investor to agree to a payment service provider&rsquo;s terms and conditions or otherwise provide satisfactory evidence of payment to Crowdcube.&nbsp; It is Investor&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that any such payment arrangements are established and maintained and that monies are transferred in accordance with clause 5.5 below.</p>

<p>5.3. If a Pitch is successful, the Investee will instruct Crowdcube to circulate a copy of the Investee&#39;s proposed Articles of Association, bond instrument or fund documentation to each Investor by email, and to request that each Investor inform Crowdcube by email within the time period specified in the email if they no longer wish to proceed with the Investment. If Crowdcube receives no response from the Investor within the specified time period, the Investor will be deemed to have confirmed his order and the Investee will accept his order and such order will become an irrevocable firm order upon expiry of the time period set out in the email, with completion of the investment conditional upon the Investee receiving payment from the Investor and provided the Investee receives at least 90% of its original Pitch target investment amount.&nbsp; If 90% of the Pitch target is not received by the Investee then clause 6.3 applies.</p>

<p>5.4. If for any reason the confirmation email is not received by an Investor (whether this is known or notified to Crowdcube or not), otherwise than as a result of fraud or gross negligence by Crowdcube, Crowdcube shall not be liable to the Investor or the Investee for any losses, claims, damages, etc suffered by the Investor, and Crowdcube shall be entitled to proceed on the assumption that the Investor wishes to proceed with the Investment.</p>

<p>5.5. If a Pitch is successful, when the Investor places an order to subscribe for shares in an Investee, and subject to non-revocation at expiry of the confirmation email an agreement shall then subsist between the Investor and the Investee, or a third party on behalf of the Investee, to transfer the subscription price of the relevant shares or debt securities (the &quot;Subscription Price&quot;) to the Investee. Shares or debt securities in the Investee will be issued to the Investor by the Investee and the Subscription Price will be transferred to the account of the Investee following the end of the Offer Period. If the Pitch is not successful, no such agreement between the Investor and the Investee shall arise.</p>

<p>5.6. If the Pitch is unsuccessful or the order not completed for any reason, the Investor&#39;s order will not be transferred to another Pitch or Investee, and no substitute service will be provided.</p>

<p>6. INVESTMENTS</p>

<p>6.1. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube&#39;s affiliates, and/or the proprietors, officers or employees of Crowdcube and/or such affiliates may consider expressing interest or subscribing for shares in an Investee. If the Investor becomes aware of this, he agrees not to rely upon the same in making a decision whether to invest in an Investee, and confirms that any decision by him to invest in an Investee is not based upon any representation, information, action, omission or otherwise of Crowdcube, its subsidiaries or affiliates or the proprietors or employees of Crowdcube, its subsidiaries or its affiliates.</p>

<p>6.2. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube approves each Pitch as a financial promotion but does not provide advice or any form of recommendation regarding the suitability or quality of the Investment. The Investor acknowledges that the approval of the Pitch as a financial promotion by Crowdcube, or the investment in an Investee by any person referred to in clause 6.1 is not an indication of approval of the Pitch generally, and the Investor confirms that it shall take no inference from or make any reference to the same.</p>

<p>6.3. The Investor confirms that should an Investee not ultimately attain the stated desired target level of investment as set out in its Pitch, through withdrawals after the expiry of the Offer Period, or failure by other Investors to transfer the Subscription Price to the Investee, neither the Investee nor Crowdcube is required to inform the Investor of this failure, and the Investor may still be required to purchase the shares he ordered, provided that the level of investment received by the Investee is at least 90% of the desired target level of investment as set out in its Pitch. If the Investee ultimately attains less than 90% of the desired target level of investment as set out in its Pitch, the agreement for investment between the Investor and Investee will not complete and Crowdcube will use its reasonable endeavours to arrange for the Investee to cancel the Investment made by the Investor and return the Subscription Price to the Investor. The Investor consents to Crowdcube releasing such information as is reasonably necessary, to the Investee to allow such return of the Subscription Price, and the Investor undertakes to co-operate with Crowdcube and the Investee, including in relation to any transaction fees or charges, to facilitate the cancellation of the Investment and the return of the Subscription Price.</p>

<p>6.4. Investors are encouraged to ensure that arrangements are put in place for their next of kin to be informed of their order and the Crowdcube process, and that instructions are provided to enable the Investor&#39;s order to be withdrawn before it is converted to a irrevocable order on the occurrence of the Investor&#39;s death, insolvency or incapacity. Crowdcube accepts no responsibility or liability for orders not being withdrawn before being converted to a firm order through the failure of the Investor to put in place such an arrangement, or the failure of the next of kin to communicate a withdrawal.</p>

<p>6.5. Investors, or in accordance with clause 6.4, their next of kin, are entitled to withdraw their order at any time prior to it becoming a firm order upon the expiry of the confirmation email as set out in clause 5.2 above.</p>

<p>6.6 If a Pitch is cancelled for any reason or does not reach its target, Investors acknowledge that Crowdcube is no longer arranging or approving financial promotions for the Investee and that if the Investor engages in any further conversations or investments outside of Crowdcube that Crowdcube has no liability or involvement with such transaction and that no statement made on Crowdcube or elsewhere by the Investee or by Crowdcube may be relied upon.</p>

<p>7. INVESTEE ARTICLES, BOND INSTRUMENT OR FUND DOCUMENTATION</p>

<p>7.1. The Investor acknowledges that, as a consequence of him becoming a shareholder of an Investee, he shall be subject to the provisions of the Investee&#39;s Articles of Association (which constitute an agreement between all of the Investee&#39;s shareholders), bond instrument or fund investment agreement, which Articles of Association, bond instrument or fund investment agreement will include certain restrictions on the shares, bonds or fund units issued and certain rights and obligations will attach to such shares, bonds or fund units and fund investments.</p>

<p>7.2. The Articles of Association will be in the form notified to the Investor by Crowdcube in the confirmation email referred to in clause 5.2 above and/or as set out on the pitch and may be subject to other documentation or disclosures.</p>

<p>7.3. The Investor acknowledges that, as a consequence of him becoming a bondholder of an Investee, he shall be subject to the provisions of the Bond Instrument or other debt instrument and associated terms and conditions of the particular debt security (which constitute an agreement between each bondholder and the relevant Investee) which will include certain restrictions on the debt securities issued and certain rights and obligations will attach to such debt securities.</p>

<p>8. REGULATION AND LIABILITY</p>

<p>8.1. The Investor acknowledges and accepts that the Website includes a forum which is an integral part of an Investee&#39;s Pitch which is intended as a service to Investees to put them in contact with Investors, and thus that Crowdcube&#39;s investigation of the Investees and the content of their Pitches is limited, and accordingly Crowdcube makes no warranty or representation and assumes no liability in respect of the Investees or the content of their Pitches. The Investor must make his own assessment of the viability, accuracy and prospects of the Investees, their Pitches, and any relevant investment propositions and should consult his professional advisers should he require any assistance in making such an assessment or should the Investor require any services whatsoever in connection with Crowdcube. In particular, the attention of the Investors is drawn to the disclaimer, risk warning and regulatory notice on each Pitch.</p>

<p>8.2. The Investor warrants, represents and undertakes to Crowdcube that (i) the Investor has categorised himself or herself correctly under clause 3 above; (ii) shall comply with any terms and conditions associated with the use of the forums on the Website, and in particular undertakes not to post any illegal, defamatory or inappropriate material or advice to invest and acknowledges that Crowdcube will in its absolute discretion have the power to determine whether posts by Investors breach this clause 8.2 or are otherwise inappropriate and may be removed by Crowdcube.</p>

<p>8.3. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube does not provide the Investor with any advice or recommendations in relation to investments. Nevertheless it is typically considered prudent for Investors to consider spreading their risk over multiple investments and Crowdcube encourages this approach.</p>

<p>8.4. The Investor acknowledges that in approving the Pitch as a financial promotion, Crowdcube has concluded that the Pitch, taken as a whole in the context of the above, is fair, clear and not misleading. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube has reviewed any factual statements included within the Pitch and obtained evidence of their accuracy from the Investee. However, the Investor&#39;s attention is drawn to the fact that the evidence is obtained from the Investee itself and has not been audited by Crowdcube, which means that it may contain inaccuracies, be incomplete or be a forgery.</p>

<p>8.5. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube has checked that aspirational statements contained within the Pitch are phrased appropriately in light of their speculative nature. However, the Investor acknowledges that the Investee is likely to be a start-up company and as such may have high ambitions which may be unachievable and exaggerated. The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube may approve statements that convey those ambitions even where it does not believe, or does not have a view on whether it is likely, that they will be fully realised and the Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube encourages Investors to consider the information provided in the context it is being provided.</p>

<p>8.6 The Investor acknowledges that Crowdcube makes no representation, warranty or undertaking relating to any claims made by Investees, including, without limitation, that the Investee and the Investment will qualify for or be subject to any tax benefits such as EIS and SEIS or that these tax benefit are pending approval of HMRC. Investor acknowledges and agrees that tax benefits may change or be disqualified and shall not hold Crowdcube liable for any loss arising as a result of a tax benefit (including , without limitation EIS or SEIS) not applying to an Investment, including without limitation in circumstances where tax has been &lsquo;clawed back&rsquo; from an Investor by HMRC.</p>

<p>8.8 Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit liability for death or personal injury resulting from the negligence of either party or their agents or employees nor for fraud by or on behalf of either party. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any liability of to the extent that liability may not be excluded or limited by any applicable law or regulation.</p>

<p>8.9 With the exception of clause 8.8 above and any breach of warranty by the Investor (which shall have unlimited liability), the liability of either party (which in the case of Crowdcube shall include Crowdcube&rsquo;s affiliate or group companies, including Crowdcube Ltd; and directors, officers and employees of Crowdcube Ltd, Crowdcube Capital Ltd, Crowdcube Nominees Ltd and Crowdcube Ventures Ltd) in contract, tort, negligence, pre-contract or other representations or otherwise arising out of this agreement or the performance of its obligations under this agreement shall be limited in aggregate to the total amount invested by Investor on www.crowdcube.com up to the date of the event leading to the claim or &pound;10,000 whichever is the lesser amount.</p>

<p>8.10&nbsp; Neither party shall be liable in contract, tort (including negligence), pre-contract or other representations (other than fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations) or otherwise under this Agreement for: (a) any economic losses (including loss of revenues, profits, contracts, business or anticipated savings); or (b) any special, indirect or consequential losses; whether or not such losses were known to the parties at the commencement of this Agreement.</p>

<p>8.11&nbsp; Where an Investor invests via a nominee, the nominee company is responsible for the administration of the nominee and trust agreement in accordance with the relevant trust agreement and neither Crowdcube, nor any subsidiary or holding company of Crowdcube, or any other subsidiary of Crowdcube&rsquo;s holding company (other than a nominee company where this forms part of Crowdcube&rsquo;s group) is a party or trustee to the nominee agreement or otherwise responsible for the Investor&rsquo;s beneficial shareholding via the nominee company or otherwise and is not liable for the actions or inactions of the nominee company or for loss or damage of any nature arising from Investors investment via a nominee.</p>
